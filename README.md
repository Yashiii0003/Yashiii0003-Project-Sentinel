Project Sentinel: Intelligence Without the Internet.

80% of enterprises block public AI (ChatGPT/Claude) due to data privacy risks. Project Sentinel is an on-premise, air-gapped RAG system designed for strict compliance environments (Finance, Legal, Healthcare).

Core Capabilities:

Zero-Trust Architecture: Runs entirely offline using local LLMs (Llama 3 via Ollama) on edge servers. No data leaves the firewall.

Dual-Engine Search: A unified interface that queries both Structured Data (SQL) and Unstructured Documents (PDFs) simultaneously.

Security First: Integrated PII redaction (Microsoft Presidio) and a "Validator Loop" that sanitizes SQL queries to prevent injection and hallucinations.

Built for the enterprise that needs AI but cannot risk the cloud.
